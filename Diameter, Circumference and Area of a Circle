  Write an application that inputs from the user the radius of a circle as an integer and prints the circle’s diameter, circumference and 
area using the floating-point value 3.14159 for π.
  [Note: You may use the predefined constant Math.PI for the value of π where Class Math is defined in package java.lang] Use the following
formulas (r is the radius):
    diameter = 2r
    circumference = 2πr
    area = πr2
Do not store the results of each calculation in a variable. Rather, specify each calculation as the value that will be output in a 
System.out.printf statement. The values produced by the circumference and area calculations are floating-point numbers.
